# LLM-Files-QA
This repository robustly implements a Question and Answer system using Large Language Models to process and extract insights from files. The proposed solution allows users to upload several document formats, such as MD, CSV, and plain text. It will then enable querying the document and provide, with high accuracy, context-aware answers.
